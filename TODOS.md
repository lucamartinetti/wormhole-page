# TODOS

## P2: SRI hashes for WASM module
Add SHA-384 integrity attributes to WASM `<script>` tag so browsers verify the
file hasn't been tampered with. Build step generates hash, injects into HTML.
Mitigates compromised-server attacks.
- Effort: S
- Depends on: WASM E2E encryption (must ship first)

## P2: Configurable relay URLs
Make mailbox and transit relay URLs configurable via JS constants or
server-injected config. Default to public relays. Lets operator switch to
self-hosted relays or failover if public relays go down.
- Effort: S
- Depends on: WASM E2E encryption

## P3: beforeunload warning during active transfer
Show browser's "Leave site?" dialog when transfer is in progress and user
tries to close tab or navigate away. Prevents accidental transfer abort.
